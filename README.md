# Food Drivr - Made with ❤️ by [Hacksmiths](http://hacksmiths.io)

## About
The [Food Drivr](http://fooddrivr.com) web and mobile app serves to make it dead simple to donate edible food to the hungry.  Open the app, press a button and a driver will come pick it up, bringing it to the less fortunate.

The [Hacksmiths](http://hacksmiths.io) are working with a charitable organization called the Waste Not Food Taxi in an effort to facilitate their philanthropic work through the creation of software.  The Waste Not Food Taxi provides a service to shuttle donated food in the city of Portland.
